# Introduction

Love Vegetables is a fun interactive website that involves the user in a vegetables knowledge quiz. It is a timed multiple choice game, with random questions each time the user starts the quiz.  The user can see the instructions on the quiz, before starting and after finishing the quiz, the user can see their score and have the option to replay. 

This is the second of five Milestone Projects that the developer must complete during his Full Stack Web Development at The Code Institute. The main requirements were to make a responsive and interactive website using primarily *HTML5*, *CSS3* and *JavaScript*.
